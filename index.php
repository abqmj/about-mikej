		<h1>Hey I'm <b>Michael Jordan</b>.</h1>
		<p>I build websites and apps to bring down wages in the work place. Automation is the future.</p>
		<p>Mcdonalds and Wendys have already implemented automated ordering templates. So why haven't you?</p>
		<p>My mobile platform, that I will build to suit your POS and your customer base, is inexpensive and very user
		friendly.</p>
