		<p>Born and raised in the Greater Metro Detroit area of Michigan. After being a self-employed commercial cleaning contracter for 10 years since the age of 18 I decided it was
			time for a change. Packed up everything and moved to ABQ New Mexico to be closer to family and go to college. After learning he did not qualify for student loans
			because of having just moved to New Mexico. He enrolled in a 10 week Deep Dive Full Stack coding bootcamp.</p>
